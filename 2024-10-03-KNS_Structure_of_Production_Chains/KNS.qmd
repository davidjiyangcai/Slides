## Research question
What are the determinants of the number and size of firms and how are tasks allocated across firms in production chains coordinated by prices?

Coase's (1937) explanation.  

## Model 
- Countable infinity of price-taking firms $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots\}$. 
- Produce a single unit of a final good.

## Make-or-buy decision
- Firm chooses upstream boundary, i.e., how far to integrate backward into the input production. 
- Firms face two types of costs: 

### In-house production costs
- Diminishing returns to management. 
- $c(\ell)$ is the cost of carrying out $\ell$ tasks in-house. 
- $c(\cdot)$ is strictly increasing, strictly convex, and continuously differentiable. 
- $c(0) = 0$, and $c'(0) > 0$ . 

### Transaction costs
- Buying and selling through the market. 
- Wedge $\delta > 1$ between buyer's and seller's prices. "Deadweight loss." 

## Equilibrium
Given 

1. Price of good at each processing stage $p: [0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}_{+}$. 
2. Feasible allocation of tasks $\{\ell_{i}\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$. 
3. Profits $\pi_{i} = p(t_{i-1}) - c(\ell_{i}) - \delta p(t_{i})$, $t_{0} = 0$, and $t_{i} = t_{i-1} - \ell_{i}$. 

Then, $(p, \mathbf{\ell})$ is an equilibrium for the production chain if 

1. $p(0) = 0$. Zero profit for suppliers of initial inputs. 
2. $\pi_i = 0$. Active firms make zero profits. 
3. $p(s)\leq c(s-t) + \delta p(t) \; \forall s, t, \; 0 \leq s \leq t \leq 1$. No intention to deviate, and inactive firms cannot enter and make profits. 

## Equilibrium exists and it's unique
### Existence
**Constructive proof:** 

#### Price function
$$T p(s) = \min_{t \in (0, s]} \{c(s-t) + \delta p(t)\} \; \forall s \in [0, 1]$$

The operator $T$ has a unique fixed point. Then, we're done with $p^{*}(s)$. 

#### Feasible allocation
Construct an allocation $\{\ell_{i}\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ from the policy function $t^{*}(s)$. 

## Equilibrium exists and it's unique
#### Number of firms 
$$n^{*} = \inf \{i \in \mathbb{N} | t^{*}_{i} = 0\} < \infty$$

then, $\{\ell_{i}\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is feasible and $(p, \mathbf{\ell})$ is an equilibrium for the production chain. $\square$

### Uniqueness
**Intuition:** 

- Another price function should be large enough to sustain nonnegative profits. Then, inactive firms could enter the market and make profits. Therefore, we would have another allocation. 
- Conversely, if there was another price function that sustains the allocation, it eliminates all profit opportunities. Hence, that price function would be lower than the optimal one. 

## Features
### Price of the final good
The minimal cost of producing the whole product when all firms make zero profits
and transaction costs cannot be avoided.
$$p^{*}(1) = c(\ell_{1}^{*}) + \delta c(\ell_{2}^{*}) + \cdots + \delta^{n-1} c(\ell_{n}^{*})$$

### Marginal conditions
#### Envelope condition
The marginal price of stage $s$ is equal to the marginal cost of the range of tasks carried on up to $s$. 
$$p'^{*}(s) = c'^{*}(\ell^{*}(s))$$

## Features
### Marginal conditions
#### Coase-Euler equation
The marginal in-house cost per task at a given firm is equal to that of its
upstream partner multiplied by gross transaction cost. 
$$\delta c'^{*}(\ell^{*}_{i+1})= c'^{*}(\ell^{*}_{i})$$

### Downstream firms are always larger than upstream firms. 
- Since the equilibrium price function is strictly convex, the marginal cost of these inputs rises as we move from upstream to downstream. 
- Hence downstream firms choose to do more in-house.

## Comparative statics
The higher the transactions costs $\delta$,

## Discussion
- Tractable and elegant model to study the structure of production chains, in particular, the boundaries of the firm. 
- They have an extension with multiple upstream partners that generates realistic supply chain networks. 
- The supply chain network structure is as rich as in the production networks literature, with ex-ante identical firms.
