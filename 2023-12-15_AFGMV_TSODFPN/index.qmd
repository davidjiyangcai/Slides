## Motivation

- COVID-19 pandemic showed that we are not prepared to face global supply chain disruptions. 
- Climate crisis and natural disasters are also a threat to local supply chains. 
- Better understanding on the transmission of shocks through the production network. 
- How can we improve the resilience of the production network? [First, we must understand its structure.]{.bg}

## The structure of domestic firm production networks
### Costa Rica (2008-2019)

- **Describe the distribution of the firm size of Costa Rican domestic formal firms by industry and year:** 
  - Number of customers. 
  - Number of suppliers. 
  - Network sales. 
  - Network purchases. 
  - Total sales. 

## The structure of domestic firm production networks
### Costa Rica (2008-2019)
- **Characterize firm and customer-supplier relationships patterns with stylized facts:** 
  - Firm-to-firm trade (9 facts). 
  - The geography of firm-to-firm trade (3 facts). 
  - Firm-to-firm trade within and across borders (3 facts). 
- **Compare these stylized facts to those reported in other countries.**

## Main results
### Firm-to-firm trade I
1. [The distribution of firm size within an industry shows substantial dispersion.]{.bg} 
2. [Domestic production networks are sparse.]{.bg} 
3. [Firm size is positively correlated to the number of connections to other firms and their average transaction.]{.bg} 
4. Firm size is positively correlated to the number of municipalities and number of industries with which a firm trades. 
5. Both the extensive and intensive margins significantly explain the variation of networks sales and purchases. As we aggregate from the firm- to the industry-level, the intensive margin becomes more important. 

## Main results
### Firm-to-firm trade II
6. Network sales (purchases) is positively correlated with the number of customers (suppliers). 
7. [On average, well-connected firms tend to trade with poorly-connected firms.]{.bg} 
8. Top customers (suppliers) account for a high percentage of a firm’s network sales (purchases). 
9. [The persistence of firm-to-firm linkages increases with firm size.]{.bg} 

## Main results
### The geography of firm-to-firm trade
10. Most firm-to-firm linkages are formed between nearby firms.
11. Trade flows between municipalities increase in the geographical proximity between the municipalities. 
12. [The number of connections decays with distance and travel time faster than the average transaction.]{.bg} 

## Main results
### Firm-to-firm trade within and across borders
13. Importer (exporter) firms are larger than non-importer (non-exporter) firms. 
14. [Most firms do not import or export directly. Most firms import indirectly, and very few export indirectly.]{.bg} 
15. Direct and total export and import shares increase with firm size.

# Data {background-color="#0077BB"}
## Data
### BCCR datasets (2008-2019)
1. **VAT transaction data (Ministry of Finance):** Annual transactions between formal firms. 
2. **Firm balance sheets (Ministry of Finance):** Total sales, 4-digit industry, and district-level location. 
3. **Employment and wagebill (CCSS).** 
4. **Firm-level international trade data (Customs):** Annual imports and exports by firm. 
5. **Shared ownership data (BCCR).** 

### Sample selection
- At least one permanent worker during the year. 
- Exclude firms in the "Diplomatic Activities" industry.

## Data
### @OpenStreetMap2023CostaDump: Talamanca, Limón to Coto Brus, Puntarenas
- **Fastest route:** 8 1/3 hours vs. **Naïve point-to-point:** 1 1/2 hours.

## Data
### @OpenStreetMap2023CostaDump
- $\text{Distance}_{od}$ and $\text{Travel time}_{od}$: Shortest path between municipalities miniziming the travel time. 
- $\text{Distance}_{oo} = \frac{2}{3} \sqrt{\text{Area} \cdot \pi}$ [@Ahlfeldt2016TheGravity]. 
- $\text{Travel time}_{oo} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{oo}}{\text{Speed}_{oo}}$. 
- $\text{Speed}_{oo}$: Weighted average of lanes' speed by its length.

## Production networks are sparse
### 32,000-48,000 firms in a given year. ~96,000 unique firms. 
On average, 1 in 5,500 of the possible connections are realized.

## Direct and total import shares [@Dhyne2021TradeNetworks]. 
$$s^{\text{Total}}_{Fj} = s_{Fj} + \sum_{i}s_{ij}s^{\text{Total}}_{Fi}$$

- $s_{Fj} = \frac{\text{Imports}_{j}}{\text{Imports}_{j} + \text{Wagebill}_{j} + \sum_{i} \text{Transactions}_{ij}}$
- $s_{ij} = \frac{\text{Transactions}_{ij}}{\text{Imports}_{j} + \text{Wagebill}_{j} + \sum_{i} \text{Transactions}_{ij}}$
- Solve for $s^{\text{Total}}_{Fj}$. 

## Most firms do not import directly, but do so indirectly.

## Direct and total export shares [@Dhyne2021TradeNetworks]. 
$$r^{\text{Total}}_{jF} = r_{jF} + \sum_{i}r_{ji}r^{\text{Total}}_{iF}$$

- $r_{jF} = \frac{\text{Exports}_{j}}{\text{Exports}_{j} + \text{Sales to households}_{j} + \sum_{i} \text{Transactions}_{ji}}$
- $r_{ji} = \frac{\text{Transactions}_{ji}}{\text{Exports}_{j} + \text{Sales to households}_{j} + \sum_{i} \text{Transactions}_{ji}}$. 

## Most firms do not export at all.

# Conclusion {background-color="#0077BB"}
## Conclusion
- We characterize several patterns present in the structure of the production networks. 
    - The patterns are not random at all. 
    - The extensive margin is very important in Costa Rica.  
- Measurement matters: 
    - Microdata vs input-output tables. 
    - Complex geography of Costa Rica. 
    - Firm exposure to international trade.
